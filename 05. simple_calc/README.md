# Simple calculator

Implement simple calculator that works in the following way:

1. User is asked to enter one of the available math operators: +, -, *, /
2. User is asked to enter operands that are two numbers. User enters both numbers in next line, separated by one or more spaces.
3. Calculate result of the operaton and show it.
4. Repeat 1-3 until user enters nothing for operator in step 1
5. Before exiting the program, show log of all operations

## Example

````
Enter operation (+ - * /): +
Enter operands: 1.123 2
Calculation: 1.123 + 2 = 2.123

Enter operation (+ - * /): /
Enter operands: 8    2
Calculation: 8 / 2 = 4

Enter operation:
Exiting calculator with the calculation log

1. 1.123 + 2 = 2.123
2. 8 / 2 = 4
